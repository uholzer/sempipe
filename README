  SemPipe: Semantic Pipeline
==============================

IMPORTANT: File formats and interfaces are not yet stable! Significant
changes to configuration files, output formats and XSL transformations
will be made!

SemPipe is a collection of tools to create files ready for upload to a
webserver generated from RDF data. architecture.svg roughly describes
how SemPipe works.

Steps to create a Website with SemPipe:
1. Describe stuff using RDF
2. Write rules in N3 that derive descriptions of the Webresources you
   want to gnerate
4. Run the SemPipe reasoner
5. Run the SemPipe planner
6. Execute the plan
7. Load generated files up to an FTP server


SemPipe consists of the following components:
- CWM[1] from the W3C is used as reasoner. Any other N3 reasoner
  should work too.
- The planner is a Python script that reads web resource descriptions
  from an N3 file and outputs a shell script wich generates all
  necessairy files.
- Some Perl scripts facilitate uploads from a Git repostiroy to an FTP
  server.

Requirements:
- A N3 reasoner, e.g. Cwm[1]
- Python 2
- rdflib <https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib>
optional:
- Perl if you want to use the upload scripts
- RDFFresnel <https://github.com/uholzer/RDFFresnel>
  in order to render RDF with Fresnel
