  SemPipe: Semantic Pipeline
==============================

SemPipe is a collection of tools to create files ready for upload to a
webserver generated from RDF data. I use it to build my website and
I add, change or remove features whenever I feel like it. Therefore,
it is at the moment not possible to give a clear description of what
SemPipe does.

SemPipe contains:
- Fresnel rendering engine in order to select a subtree of an RDF
  graph
- Some XSLTs in order to convert the result of the Fresnel renderer to
  XHTML 5 or XHTML 1
- A Python programme that builds files for a webserver based on a
  description in RDF (Invokes rendering with Fresnel and
  transformations, writes typemaps and .htaccess files)
- Perl scripts to update an FTP according to changes made in a GIT
  repository

There is no documentation available yet, but you are free to play with
this stuff.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- Perl
- rdflib <https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib>
- rdflib-sparql <https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-sparql>
